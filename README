Generic long poll server used by Launchpad and Landscape.


Building
--------

txlongpoll needs a recent RabbitMQ with support for rejection. Maverick's
1.8.0 is not sufficient, but 2.1.1 works fine, so >= Natty is OK.

You also need to get lp:rabbitfixture, build it and drop the egg in
./download-cache/dist in order for txlongpoll to build.

 $ make build


Testing
-------

 $ bin/test
