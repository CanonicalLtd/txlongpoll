Generic long poll server used by Launchpad and Landscape.


Building
--------

txlongpoll needs a recent RabbitMQ with support for rejection. Maverick's
1.8.0 is not sufficient, but 2.1.1 works fine, so >= Natty is OK.

You also need to get lp:rabbitfixture, build it and drop the egg in
./download-cache/dist in order for txlongpoll to build.  You will also possibly
need to do the same for testresources-0.2.4_r58 until it reaches PyPI.

 $ make build


Testing
-------

 $ bin/test


Running
-------

 $ bin/txlongpoll txlongpoll
