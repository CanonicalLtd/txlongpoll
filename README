Generic long poll server used by Launchpad and Landscape.


Dependencies
------------

By default txlongpoll attempts to build without going to the network;
instead it tries to find all dependencies from download-cache/dist,
and you must download all the dependencies yourself.

If you prefer to use resources from the 'net, PyPI for example, then
prepend OFFLINE=0 to your make commands:

- OFFLINE=0 make build

- OFFLINE=0 make check


Building
--------

 $ make build

will build only those parts needed to run txlongpoll. No support for
tags or testing.


Testing
-------

 $ make check

will build all the test-related parts of txlongpoll and then do a full
test run, but

 $ make bin/testpy

will just do the first part.

There is testrepository <https://launchpad.net/testrepository>
support, so you can also do the following:

 $ testr init
 $ testr run

This is probably the best way to develop txlongpoll.


Running
-------

 $ bin/twistd txlongpoll
