Generic long poll server used by Launchpad and Landscape.


Dependencies
------------

By default txlongpoll attempts to build without going to the network;
instead it tries to find all dependencies from download-cache/dist,
and you must download all the dependencies yourself.

If you prefer for buildout to find dependencies from PyPI then comment
out the ``install-from-cache = true`` line in buildout.cfg.

To run the tests you may also need lp:rabbitfixture (bzr branch
lp:rabbitfixture). Build it and drop the egg in download-cache/dist.
You may also need to do the same for testresources-0.2.4_r58 until it
reaches PyPI.

txlongpoll needs a recent RabbitMQ with support for rejection. Maverick's
1.8.0 is not sufficient, but 2.1.1 works fine, so >= Natty is OK.


Building
--------

 $ make build

will build only those parts needed to run txlongpoll. No support for
tags or testing.


Testing
-------

 $ make check

will build all the test-related parts of txlongpoll and then do a full
test run, but

 $ make bin/test

will just do the first part.


Running
-------

 $ bin/twistd txlongpoll
