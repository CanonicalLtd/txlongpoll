Generic long poll server used by Launchpad and Landscape.


Building
--------

Grab the latest storm egg from Launchpad, put it in download-cache/dist.
lazr.amqp needs storm.twisted, which is only in trunk.

It also needs a recent RabbitMQ with support for rejection. Maverick's
1.8.0 is not sufficient, but 2.1.1 works fine, so >= Natty is OK.

 $ python bootstrap.py
 $ bin/buildout


Testing
-------

The test suite needs the system RabbitMQ set up in the Landscape dev
config. dev/landscape-rabbitmq-setup from lp:landscape will do that.

 $ bin/test
