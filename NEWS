* OOPS reports can be reported directly over AMQP if the oops-exchange
  option is given. The oops-prefix option has been renamed to
  oops-reporter to fit in with the long term terminology oops has
  adopted. (Robert Collins, Gavin Panella)

  Zope's test runner. Support for testrepository has also been
  added. (Gavin Panella)
